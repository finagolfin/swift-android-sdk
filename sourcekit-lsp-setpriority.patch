   // `setpriority` is only able to decrease a process's priority and cannot elevate it. Since Swift taskâ€™s priorities
   // can only be elevated, this means that we can effectively only change a process's priority once, when it is created.
   // All subsequent calls to `setpriority` will fail. Because of this, don't log an error.
